# EBS

This is a billing system I am developed using Asp.net mvc 5 with C# as backend language, SQL server and ADO.NET as a data access Layer.
The system Currently has the following Features:
1. Login
2. Customers
3. Billing/ Invoicing
4. Payment
5. Receipts

The login is hard coded and there's no page to create users or manage users.
The Customers Feature involves anything related to customers from registering them to updating their data and stuff like that.
The Billing Feature is the most important part of the application and that is where we deal with anything related to billing customers.
Payment is a feature that handles payments and balances and stuff like that.
Finally, the receipt feature is a simple feature that allows the system user to see the list of receipts and have the ability to download them as pdf.
